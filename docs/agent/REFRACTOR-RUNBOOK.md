# DM-vault Refactor Runbook

This is the authoritative, reset-proof plan for the DM-vault Guardian agent. All refactor steps, protected features, and safety rules are defined here.

## Phase 0: Bootstrap (Do First)
- Add this runbook as docs/agent/REFRACTOR-RUNBOOK.md
- Add docs/agent/STATUS.md (copy template from user or prior version)
- Add docs/agent/refactor-log.md (append-only, log every step)
- Add reports/ directory (for future reports)
- Add archive/ directory with .gitkeep
- Ensure .gitignore includes .DS_Store
- If any old refactor plans exist, add a pointer to this file or move them to archive/

## Phase 1: Register Protected Features
- ... (rest of runbook omitted for brevity)

# (Full runbook to be filled in or updated as needed)
