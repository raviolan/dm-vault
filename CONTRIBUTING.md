# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributions. Short guide:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change.
2. Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` to verify the site builds.
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and link to screenshots if relevant.

Code style: keep changes focused. For larger changes, open an Issue first to discuss.
